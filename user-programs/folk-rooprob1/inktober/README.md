Inspired by Inktober, the month-long art challenge, Folk February is a list of prompts for making Folk programs for each day in February. Back in October 2024, I used the Inktober prompts to create about a dozen small demo programs that I later presented at a conference. It helped me get more familiar with Folk and useful interaction patterns.

How to participate

    Make a program based on the prompt (or not based on the prompt, I'm a discord message not a cop)
    Post about it. Take pictures or videos or share code or whatever. Post it in ⁠talk-folk-photos or on social media or in a text to your family.
    Repeat


Recommendations

    Participating every day is intense. You don't have to. I certainly won't 😅. You could choose one prompt from each week and just do it once a week. You could do every other day.
    The point is to push you to make something. If you make more than zero things, you have succeeded.
    The prompts are suggestions. You are a smart, creative person with agency to make the best thing for your situation. Use that agency shamelessly.
